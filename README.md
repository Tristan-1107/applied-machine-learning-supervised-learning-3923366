## Course Description

In this course, Matt Harrison—a Python and data science corporate trainer, author, speaker, consultant, and advisor—shows you how to apply supervised learning techniques to real-world problems, focusing on both classification and regression tasks. Start with basic models like linear regression, and then advance to more complex algorithms like decision trees and XGBoost. Plus, explore model evaluation, optimization, and deployment techniques. With practical challenges and solutions, this course prepares you to apply supervised learning to solve problems in industries like healthcare, finance, and real estate.

## Installation

There are two options for installation:

1. Use Codespaces (the video walks through this):

 - Click on the green "Code" button. Then click on the "Codespaces" tab. Click the "+" button to create a codespace. 
 - Wait a minute or two for the Codespace to provision
 - Open the Ju[pyter notebook


2. Install with `uv`:

 - Install `uv` as per https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/
 - Check out this project:
   
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:LinkedInLearning/applied-machine-learning-supervised-learning-3923366.git
   ```

 - Change into the directory of the project:

   ```bash
   cd applied-machine-learning-supervised-learning-3923366
   ```

 - Run `uv sync` to build the environment.

 - Launch Jupyter with:

  ```bash
  uv run jupyter lab
  ```

 - Open the notebook
